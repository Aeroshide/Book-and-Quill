# Book and Quill
A windows application that displays song lyrics based on what you're currently listening on Spotify in real-time using genius as a lyrics service

## HOW TO USE:
- Make sure Spotify is opened as a window, minimizing the window is okay as long as its not minimized to system tray
- That's kinda it, just make sure the status is green in the app, and the lyrics should just show in the app

## Keybinds:
Ctrl-R: Redetect Spotify (use if spotify is wrongly detected)
